# Devzery Frontend Technical Assignment: API Chaining Dashboard


I have created a comprehesive Dashboard to test API's using features like chaining of responses in request body or in query parameters, responsive layout and proper state management.
I have used redux to store the responses of the API calls. User can select from dropdown which API reponse to use for chaining.
Also added feature to customize headers.
